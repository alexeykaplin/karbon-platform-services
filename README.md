## Xi IoT Overview
The Nutanix Xi IoT platform delivers local compute and AI for IoT edge devices, converging the edge and cloud into one seamless data processing platform. The Xi IoT platform eliminates complexity, accelerates deployments, and elevates developers to focus on the business logic powering IoT applications and services. Now developers can use a low-code development platform to create application software via APIs instead of arduous programming methods.

## Xi IoT Trial
This Xi IoT Quick Start leverages the Xi IoT Trial. The trial is a limited-time, ready-to-deploy implementation of the Xi IoT edge computing platform. The Xi IoT Trial provides pre-built applications and data connectors hosted on its own infrastructure. This instant architecture demonstrates how to quickly develop and test IoT applications in the cloud for seamless deployment to the edge.

Nutanix has already created the basic infrastructure you need to get started.

**What’s In the Xi IoT Trial?**
1. Xi IoT management console, which provides the base for your Xi IoT trial.
1. A Starter project that includes:
    * You (the project user).
    * Xi Edge stack, connected and ready to go: no cluster or bare-metal resources required on your part.
    * YouTube-8M application, just waiting for your YouTube-8M video URL.
    * Xi IoT Sensor smartphone app, if you want to use your own video instead of YouTube-8M.

**What Can I Do with the Xi IoT Trial?**
* Stream video from YouTube-8M video or your smartphone to the Xi Cloud edge.
* Automatically run containerized apps at the edge to perform object recognition on your video.
* Stream the results back to the Xi IoT console or your smartphone, with recognized objects highlighted in your video.
