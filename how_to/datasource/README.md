## Registering a Data Source

In Xi IoT, data sources can be set up in order to connect cloud entities such as Applications and Data Pipelines to edge devices. Xi IoT ia equipped with a few ready to use protocols
such as MQTT, RTSP, and GigE Vision.  

We also support many other data sources as well which can be deployed using the Xi IoT CLI. The command will take YAML in order to specify criteria such as service domain and topics. 
You can look inside the different data source subfolders to see how to implement them with Xi IoT. All of the documentation assumes you have correctly set up the Xi IoT CLI.
