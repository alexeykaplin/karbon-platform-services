# XI IOT - DEEPOMATIC DEMO APPLICATION GUIDE

Explore a gesture recognition demo application, as seen at .NEXT 2019. Some other gestures have been included, can you find them all?

## Xi IoT Overview

The Nutanix Xi IoT platform delivers local compute and AI for IoT edge devices, converging the edge and cloud into one seamless data processing platform. The Xi IoT platform eliminates complexity, accelerates deployments, and elevates developers to focus on the business logic powering IoT applications and services. Now developers can use a low-code development platform to create application software via APIs instead of arduous programming methods.

## Xi IoT Trial
This Xi IoT demo leverages the Xi IoT Trial. The trial is a limited-time, ready-to-deploy implementation of the Xi IoT edge computing platform. The Xi IoT Trial provides pre-built applications and data connectors hosted on its own infrastructure. This instant architecture demonstrates how to quickly develop and test IoT applications in the cloud for seamless deployment to the edge.

Nutanix has already created the basic infrastructure you need to get started.
